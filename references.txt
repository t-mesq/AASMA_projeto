“For this purpose, we consider the Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation of the problem, in which the optimal solution can be viewed as a sequence of decisions. This allows us to use RL to produce near-optimal solutions by increasing the probability of decoding “desirable” sequences. “

“Each state includes features from the problem instance, the solution and the running history. Stationary features, such as the location and demand of each customer, are considered as problem-specific since they are invariant across solutions. Solution-specific features are based on the current travel- ing plan.“
"The actions can be classified into two classes, intra-route operators and inter-route operators. An intra-route operator attempts to reduce traveling distance of an individual route, while inter-route operators aim at reducing total traveling distance by moving customers between more than one route"
